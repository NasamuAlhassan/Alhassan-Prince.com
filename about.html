            <h2>ALHASSAN PRINCE</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the most significant words in the Bible are these by our Lord: “And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”  That means, if you don’t know the truth, you are not free; you are in bondage.</p> 
            <p>
                The book you are about to read is the most comprehensive work to date on spiritual warfare and the kingdom of Satan.  It is detailed and factual, not theory.  For the first time, you will learn the truth about the Dark Kingdom: its organization, methods of operation and power.  It is my sincere hope that this truth will make you free and enable you to effectively engage the Dark Kingdom in spiritual combat. </p>
